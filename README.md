# The Faithful Remnant – Witnesses Through the Ages  
நம்பிக்கையுள்ள எஞ்சியோர் – காலங்கள் வழியாக சாட்சிகள்

**A Biblical Call to the Remnant in the Little Season**  

All glory to the Lord Jesus Christ — the Lamb who preserves His remnant forever!

“Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.”  
(Revelation 14:12)

From Noah to the final overcomers, God has always kept a faithful remnant — those who refused Babylon’s spirit and worshiped Him alone.

This book strengthens us in the little season: stand firm, endure, overcome by the blood of the Lamb.

**All glory to the Lamb who was slain and now reigns forever!**  
Come, Lord Jesus — gather Your remnant eternally!

ஆமென் | அல்லேலூயா | Hallelujah forever!
